# Covid-19 Variants-of-concern

This repository contains the code for the analysis of the Covid-19 Variants of Concern (VOCs) using the Nextstrain pipeline. This is a translation of an existing publication.

Module repository: [https://github.com/kraemer-lab/vneyard](https://github.com/kraemer-lab/vneyard)
Project: vocpl
Original publication: [Dispersal patterns and influence of air travel during the global expansion of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.06.001)

The complete pipeline is available in the `pipeline-` modules (e.g. `pipeline-fasttree` for the FastTree variant).
