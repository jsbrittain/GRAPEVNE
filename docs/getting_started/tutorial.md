# Workflow tutorial

This tutorial walks through some of the considerations of building a
functioning workflow in GRAPEVNE, and provides various side-bars and
discussions on aspects such as how the modules were build, how to specify the
runtime environment, and how to deal with data-dependent workflows.

If you are instead interested in how to use existing modules then see our
[GRAPEVNE Builder](quickstart/builder.md) guide.
