# Challenge

Build the following workflow in Phyloflow modules:

(graph and rule specifications here)

Outline:

- Node 1 (mock input; use `pip` `Random-Word` in `envs` to build a list)
- Node 2 (preprocess input from node 1; filter by word length)
- Node 3 (input from Node1 and Node2; count words beginning with each letter)

Once complete, change parameters on Node 2 and re-run.

Once complete, build a replacement for Node 2 (reverse letter sequence) and
make the substitution in the graph.

Provide expandable solutions.
