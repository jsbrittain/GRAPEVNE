# Workflow tutorial

This tutorial walks through some of the considerations of building a
functioning workflow in GRAPEVNE, and provides various side-bars and
discussions on aspects such as how the modules were build, how to specify the
runtime environment, and how to deal with data-dependent workflows.

```{note}
This tutorial demonstrates the manual steps required to create modules and build a workflow from them. There are two more accessible approaches to using GRAPEVNE:
1. If you are instead interested in how to use existing modules to build workflows, then see our [GRAPEVNE Builder](../quickstart/builder.md) guide.
2. If you are interested in creating a wrapper module around an existing piece of software or custom scripts, then see our [Module Builder](module_builder.md) guide, which provides a graphical user interface that is suitable in most cases. If there are unique requirements that necessitate a deeper understanding of module structure, then the current tutorial is more appropriate.
