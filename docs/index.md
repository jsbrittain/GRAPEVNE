GRAPEVNE is an interactive environment for building and validating data
processing workflows built around [Snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io/).
The grapevine is a symbol of growth, development, and productivity, highlighting
the software's ability to help users grow and develop their analytical pipelines.
It was originally focussed on solving phylogenetic problems, but has developed
to support a broad range of use-cases.

**GRAPEVNE is currently a prototype and is subject to major revisions**
