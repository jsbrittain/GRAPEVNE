# Getting Started

## Installation

PhyloFlow currently supports Linux/MacOS, though a Docker image should be available soon.

To run locally, clone the phyloflow repository and launch:
`run.sh`
from the command line.

Note: You will need to select 'github directory listing' from the Builder drop-down to access modules. Local modules must (currently) be stored in a specific directory structure mirroring the SnakeShack.

### Snakeshack

To make a copy of the modules repository available on your local machine, clone the SnakeShack ([https://github.com/jsbrittain/snakeshack](https://github.com/jsbrittain/snakeshack)) into a sister folder to PhyloFlow, e.g.:

```
repos
|- phyloflow
|- snakeshack
```

Phyloflow should now be able to find the local modules.

## Modules

Details on module construction will follow.
