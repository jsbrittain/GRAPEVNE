# Dengue Sequence Analysis

This tutorial walks through the construction of a Dengue Sequence Analysis, a workflow designed for the retrieval, processing, subsampling, and phylogenetic analysis of the latest dengue virus sequences . The workflow makes use of pre-constructed modules that are provided in the [Dengue repository](https://github.com/rhysinward/dengue_pipeline) and publically available data.

```{note}
The workflow makes use of software that is available on Linux and MacOS, but is unlikely to run on Windows at this time.
