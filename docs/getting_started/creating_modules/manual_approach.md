# The manual approach

This section explains how modules work as Snakemake files, and what additional specifications we apply in order to permit the construction of workflows.

To begin, we recommend looking through "Wrapping a Python script (manual approach)", which walks through the process of taking an existing analysis script and converting it into a GRAPEVNE module. Since GRAPEVNE modules are special forms a Snakemake Snakefile, you will see how the Snakefile is formed, and how the GRAPEVNE approach is applied.

Afterwards, we recommend looking through the "Tutorial" section, which provides a more detailed explanation of the GRAPEVNE approach, and how to apply it to your own analysis scripts. The tutorial walks through the first few stages of the manual conversion of an existin pipeline, and demonstrates how that can be built up to a full workflow.
