# Creating Modules

By now you will have made use of a range of modules and seen how to quickly and easily build workflows from pre-existing modules. In this tutorial we will show you how to create your own modules, and how they can just as easily be integrated into GRAPEVNE workflows.

There are two ways to create modules in GRAPEVINE:
1. Using the Module Builder - this is the recommended approach in most cases where you want to create a module from a script or command line tool. GRAPEVNE comes with a graphical interface that will guide you through the process of creating the module.
2. The manual approach - creating the module in Snakemake directly. This is useful when you want to create a module that is not a script or command line tool, or when you want to create a module that is more complex than the Module Builder can handle.
